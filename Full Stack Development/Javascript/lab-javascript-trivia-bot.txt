codingFact=favoriteLanguage+" is known as a multi-paradigm language, which means it doesn't force you to code in a single style. Instead, it supports and allows you to mix different approaches. You can use procedural programming like C, object-oriented programming with classes, generic programming with templates, and even functional programming concepts. This flexibility is a core reason it's so powerful for a wide range of applications."
